Notes for parameters in BP:

- train_size: percentage of training data to use.
- model.out_sizes: dimension for POS tag embeddings.
- model.add_feat: if true, we explicitly append 'case' feature to the character input.

Multitask learning setup:
- mtl_swap: If we want to alternate update for auxiliary and main task.
            If set to true, for each batch we perform two updates, first pass
            is updates based from auxiliary loss, second pass is based on
            main task loss.
- model.apply_mtl: morphological feature to predict in the auxiliary task.
- model.alpha: weight for main task.
- model.beta: weight for auxiliary task.
- model.hierarchy: use 2 layers of bi-LSTM encoder, use the first 2 layers for 
                   auxiliary task.
